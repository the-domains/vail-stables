Staff Favorite!

Where giant Cow Parsnip towers over the heads of the horses. 

Includes eveything you see on the Rocky Point Ride with wide open views of the surrounding mountain ranges.  For the extra 30 minutes, riders are immersed in the magical garden of an Aspen glade with intensely white trunks, and a leafy green canopy that changes color throughout the day, as the sun moves.  Deer stare at the passersby with unblinking eyes, hiding their fawns in the thick, green underbrush that appears to cover everything.  Scenic views of the Gore Range, Vail ski slopes and Beaver Creek ski slopes.
