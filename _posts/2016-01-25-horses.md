Meno on the left, Tom on the right.  Tom is a big APHA, that is short for registered Paint horse.  His name should be Steady Eddy because we can count on him to be consistent.

Todd on the left.  Spot on the right.  Todd is a big draft/paint cross, much like Spot.  Probably the longest running horse at the stables.  He is semi-retired now because he has an unpredictable suspensory ligament problem.  The entertainment value is great as he loves to scratch his behind on the bushes.   ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0fa54c8f-d88b-40c5-b19c-a243076e78ec.jpg)
