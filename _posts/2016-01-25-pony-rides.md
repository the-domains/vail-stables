# Parent-Led Pony Rides

Sweet ponies for the tiniest Lil' Buckaroos.  Moms and dads lead the ponies with their kiddos atop, along the trails around the ranch.

Parent-Led Pony Rides    Everyday between 10am and 1pm.  $20/20 minutes on our scenic trails.  Walk-up, no reservations taken, first come, first served.  2 ponies ready to go at 10am.  Kids as young as 1 yr old can ride!  We have tiny helmets.
