description: "How Late in the Season Are You Open?     Sadly, we close October 1st, 2015.  A blizzard is coming.   Paying Separately   The credit card you use to hold your reservation is NOT CHARGED at the time of booking.  It is authorized for $1 and subsequently voided to assure the booking system that the card is a valid card.  You may pay with cash, multiple credit cards or by doing a lot of chores once you arrive.  If you show up with cash you receive $5 off each rider.     Hopefully you have good friends (and you know how family can be), that won't bail at the last minute, causing your card to be charged for no-shows or last minute cancellations by the people you love, or don't, in your group.  See Rain or Shine below and Cancellations below.   Weight Limit   Height/Weight Proportion Requirement. We hate to say it, but if your legs are not strong enough to hold your 50 gallon beer belly on the upper side of the saddle, there could be a problem.  If a rider is under 6' tall, the rider must not weigh more than 245. If the rider is 6' or taller, the weight limit is 275. If the rider is over 6'6\", the weight limit is 300lbs.  We beg and plead with you now, please don't make us put you on the scale!!!       Age Limit   Kids must be a very mature 5 years old, (like 15 yr-olds are), to ride.  They ride their own horse, however, the guide leads the horse of 5 and 6 yr olds from the top of their horse, not on foot!  Seven year-olds can control the reins by themselves, as long as they are doing well. Kids have to be 5 years old to ride. Not 4 and 3/4, or 4 yrs and 11 months, remember, they have to be very, very mature, like a 16 yr-old. This is an insurance requirement!  If you plan on fibbing about your child's age, causing your child and their siblings to also fib, (you should see the kids stammer as they attempt to maintain the parents' lies) the insurance company will inform you that YOU can cover the cost of any unforseen incident that could happen at the ranch.  We will say the same thing.      NONO DOUBLEDOUBLE RIDINGRIDING      None of the stables in the Vail Valley allow doubledouble riding.  Having said that, we are the ONLY stable that has supervised childcare for your lil' dogies while you enjoy your ride.  Add on Pony Camp While You Ride for $30/hour, or Cowboy Camp while you ride for $15/hour.  Both options are fun and enjoyable for everyone in your group.    WARNING!!  Strict Cancellation Policy   Horseback Rides - Please do not book a ride on your travel day.  Travel dilemmas are not an exception to the cancellation policy.  We hate to be the additional jerk that upholds the policy, on the day you have a travel problem.  A full 24 hours and 5 minutes notice required to cancel, change, alter, subtract people, change your mind, get sick, stub your toe, eat too much, develop bad gas, find something better to do, double book yourself, have your plane delayed, ect, to avoid a cancellation fee. You are guaranteeing your arrival, and usage of the horse blocked out of the schedule, with your credit card.  Think $$$$ lost when we charge it, or a lot of shoveling.  And, you wouldn't want to miss out on the greatest adventure Colorado has to offer the flatlander.   Locate the change/cancel button at the bottom of your confirmation email to alter or cancel prior to the 24 hour and 5 minute mark.    Camps - No Cancellations, no makeup days, no sick days, no switching days, NO EXCEPTIONS, ever.  Any attempt to cancel camp days you have booked will be completely, and pitifully ignored.  There just aren't any exceptions.  Not a one.  If you know this ahead of time, maybe we won't seem like jerks when we uphold the policy.  And, you wouldn't want to miss out on the greatest adventure Colorado has to offer the flatlander kiddo.   What to Wear   Don't ask Trevor. His answer is always \"clothes\". Folks, we have seen everything from mini skirts and high heels, to parkas and leather pants, and the horses didn't seem to mind! We recommend; a fleece jacket, long pants (because chapped thighs are worse than chapped lips), t-shirt and sturdy shoes and a hat. We do provide slickers and helmets FREE of charge. And we recommend that everyone wear a helmet. They don't call them the Rocky Mountains because they are giant sand hills.  Parents, it is up to you if your 14-17 yr old wears a helmet or not.  If you can't bring yourself to argue with your teenager, just wink at the person behind the counter, repeatedly, until they figure out the code for \"Be the bad guy for me\".   We will force on on their head.   Note the sturdy shoes to the right?              What to Bring   It depends on what you want us to find on the trail next year. Lost keys, phones and wallets are swallowed up by the forest floor. We do have horn bags for your belongings, but we recommend you leave them in the vehicle.  We'll hold your keys if you trust us enough.      Cameras   Don't forget it! The photo ops are plentiful. The wranglers are always willing to stop on the trail and take many photos from varying angles. And because we care, we may even tell you to suck in your gut.     Restrooms   Don't forget to flush! No restrooms on the trails so please visit our lovely facility before you check in for your ride.  If you find it unacceptable, please use the bushes right behind the building.      Water and Sunscreen   We do sell frosty cold, bottled water and have a large supply of sunscreen on hand. We recommend you apply 30 minutes prior to ride time.  We also have that germ-killing gel that makes you healthier/sicker.  According to Aunt Pat, you have to eat a bushel of dirt a year to be healthy.      Food and Souveniers   We have various snacks and chilled, sugary beverages for sale in the office.  T-shirts in various styles and all sizes.  Old tack used by the horses at Vail Stables over the last 30 years too.  Pick anything off of the wall with a price tag and it can be yours!     Gratuities   YES, the guides love to receive tips from you since we only pay them two-bits a day.  If you do enjoy your ride, hug your horse, and tip your guide!   20% auto-gratuity added for groups of 6 or more, and for Premium Rides such as The Elk Springs Ride, Trotting Rides, and Private Rides. It will be added at the time of booking so you know the total ahead of time.  Oh, and for those that try to beat the system by booking separately, yet insist on riding together, we'll tack on another 20% fer our troubles.     Gentle Horses   That is all we allow at the ranch. If you are looking for a spirited, fast, horse, you'll need to sign up for one of our Trotting Rides in which we will give the horses a swig of Red Bull.     Nose-to-Tail   We are not sure how it could be anything but nose-to-tail. The trail is only 12\" wide! The USFS would frown upon our treading on the area to the side of the trails. The fact that we climb 600 feet in elevation in the first 20 minutes, keeps most riders very occupied. After that, the Aspen trees are so close together, one could conceivably clunk their knee pretty hard if they went off trail. Also, there are the various horse personalities that are involved. Some do not like others to pass or invade their space. There is a heirarchy within every herd. The horses are lined up according to their friendships.     Terrain   Scenic, mountainous terrain that goes up and down, up and down, much like the ski slopes. Heavily treed in some areas, wide open vistas in others.  Mountain meadows, forested areas, bubbling creeks (on Half-Day Ride), immense Aspen glades.  No cliffs or drop-offs to worry about. The horses stay on the trail in all of the important areas.     Rain or Shine   We have yellow slickers, Colorado Style. We do ride in the rain! Many guests have returned from a ride, beaming with satisfaction, claiming the ride was the best of their life. The forest sparkles and sings in the rain. Your ride may be delayed as long as 60 minutes to allow major storms to pass. Rides in progress may be cut short due to major lightning, and will not be refunded, nor issued rainchecks. No exceptions. We sit in the banana belt of Vail and normally do not have any problems with the weather.     Pony Rides - No Minimum Age Limit   It might be a 3 person job with one leading, one pushing and one confusing the rest, but tiniest Lil' Dogie can enjoy our ponies.   Parents lead the ponies on our trails.  The photographer in your group will use up 2 memory cards on this special event.  $20/20 minutes will tucker out the whole gang.       Group Discounts or Coupons   Discounts? Coupons?  $5 discount when you book online AND pay in cash.  No coupons in any of the guide books.  No discounts for groups.  Groups of 6 or more are charged a 20% auto gratuity.        Shuttle   Most of the hotels in Vail will run you up in on of their shuttle and retrieve you after the ride.   Otherwise, taxis can be reasonable if you work the sticker price.  Busses do not come our way.  Walking uphill for one mile seems like no problem, until you are in the middle of the hill.      Bringing Other People's Kids  Click on the two files below marked Woga Waiver pg 1 and pg 2, to see and print our 2-sided waiver which you can print and have parents sign, and then you will be able to drop off the grandkids or a friend or send your world travelers alone on the hotel shuttle, worry-free.
