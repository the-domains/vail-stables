# Dark Timber Tour

2 Hour Ride

Times Vary - Click the Check Availability Button to see what rides are availailable on your special date.

Look for wildlife on this ride as it climbs to 9400ft in elevation. Elk, deer, whistle pigs, fox and singing birds are well camouflaged in the dense, white stands of Aspen. The giant Cow Parsnip crowds the trails and towers over the heads of the horses, with its large green leaves and delicate, white flower. Monkshood grows in a very special damp area of the trail. Wildflowers of all colors take turns crowding the sunny areas of the trails. The views from two lookout points are perfect for the landscape photographer in the bunch. A short section of beetle-kill mixed with new growth offers a cool respite from the summer sun. The two hour includes both the one hour, and the 1.5 hour trails. However, you will not see the same area twice.
