# Rocky Point Tour

1 Hour Ride

No shortage of sunshine on this 600ft. climb in elevation. Riders have a 360 degree view of the Vail Valley, Gore Range, Beaver Creek, Bald Mountain and the Vail Ski Slopes. If you forgot deodorant, grind some fragrant sage between your fingers and apply liberally. Explore an Aspen glade in its infancy. Take in the beauty of grassy meadow where a rustic old cabin sits that was once the site of many old cowboy dinners.   No cliffs to fall from on any of our rides.
