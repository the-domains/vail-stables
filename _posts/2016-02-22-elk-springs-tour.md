# Elk Springs Tour

Half-Day Ride

Heading to the west, this technical backcountry ride climbs to 10,000ft in elevation by traversing large meadows, steep grades, thick, dark, fragrant stands of Lodge Pole pine trees, densely populated Aspen glades, bubbling creeks and lush undergrowth. Plop down on your belly and slurp from a fresh, cold spring. We've had hardy 6 year olds and one amazing 91 year-old grandma finish the route. We are saying, in advance, that there is not a shortcut home, so you have to be tough. You are in the saddle for half the day.     CALL (855) RIDE-VAIL for AVAILABILITY if you are unable to book online.Includes deli lunch, humorous t-shirt and gratuity for the guide.
