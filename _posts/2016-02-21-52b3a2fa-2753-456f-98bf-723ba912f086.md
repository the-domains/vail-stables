# Location

Vail Village and Lionshead are on the south side of I-70\.  We are on the north side, about 4 miles to the east of Safeway.  

Driving from West Vail on North Frontage Rd.

Head East on the NORTH Frontage Road.  When you reach the round-a-bout at Exit 176, go south under I-70, around the round-a-bout on the South side, and BACK UNDER I-70 to the North side.  

Once in that round-a-bout, make an immediate right hand turn, to the East, onto Spraddle Creek Road.

Go up one mile.

Driving from Downton Vail Village or Lionshead, Cascade, East Vail, Denver, Avon, Beaver Creek.  

Get to the north side round-a-bout, at Exit 176 on I-70 (The Main Vail Exit)

Once in that round-a-bout, make an immediate right hand turn, to the East, onto Spraddle Creek Road.

Go up one mile.

When you reach the cul-de-sac at the metal gates, turn right.  (It's the only thing you can do.)

We are 50 yards up.
