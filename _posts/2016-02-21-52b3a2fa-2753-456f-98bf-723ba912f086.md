## Locality

Vail Village and Lionshead are on the south side of I-17\.  We are on the north side, about 4 miles to the east of Safeway.  

We are 50 yards up.

Driving from West Vail on North Frontage Rd.

Head East on the NORTH Frontage Road.  When you reach the round-a-bout at Exit 176, go south under I-70, around the round-a-bout on the South side, and BACK UNDER I-70 to the North side.  

Once in that round-a-bout, make an immediate right hand turn, to the East, onto Spraddle Creek Road.

Go up one mile.

Turn right onto the dirt road in the cul-de-sac.  (It's the only thing you can do.)
